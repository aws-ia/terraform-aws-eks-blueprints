## Setting up PostgreSQL database
Setup an instance of Aurora/RDS PostgreSQL </br>
Use the CLI commands from the script **setup.sh** to run DML and DDL changes to the database. </br>
Make sure that the database credentials are correctly reflected in the script **[secrets.sh](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-vpc-lattice-demos/blob/master/eks-cross-cluster/secrets.sh)** so that the datastore service can connect to it.
