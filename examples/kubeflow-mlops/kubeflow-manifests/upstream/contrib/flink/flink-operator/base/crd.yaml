                              crashes or exits. The reason for termination is passed
                              to the handler. The Pod''s termination grace period
                              countdown begins before the PreStop hooked is executed.
                              Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the container
                              will eventually terminate within the Pod''s termination
                              grace period. Other management of the container blocks
                              until the hook completes or until the termination grace
                              period is reached. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks'
