It involves integrating a wide range of open-source tools and AWS services as well as expertise in AWS and Kubernetes.</p> <p>AWS customers have asked for patterns that demonstrate how to integrate the landscape of Kubernetes tools and make it easy for them to provision complete, opinionated EKS clusters that meet specific application requirements.

However, to simplify the pattern experience, we have defined everything in one workspace and provided instructions to provision the patterns using a targeted apply approach. Users are encouraged to investigate a Terraform project structure that suites their needs; EKS Blueprints for Terraform does not have an opinion in this matter and will defer to Hashicorp's guidance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Patterns are not intended to be consumed in-place in the same manner that one would consume a module.

This results in a terraform failure when the same blueprint is being recreated due to the existing log group left behind.</p> <p>There are two options here:</p> <ol> <li> <p>During cluster creation set <code>var.create_cloudwatch_log_group</code> to <code>false</code>. This will tell the EKS module to not create the log group, but instead let the EKS service create the log group. This means that upon cluster deletion the log group will be left behind but there will not be Terraform failures if you re-create the same cluster as Terraform does not manage the log group creation/deletion anymore.</p> </li> <li> <p>During cluster creation set <code>var.create_cloudwatch_log_group</code> to <code>true</code>. This will tell the EKS module to create the log group via Terraform. The EKS service will detect the log group and will start forwarding the logs for the log types enabled. Upon deletion terraform will delete the log group but depending upon any un-forwarded logs, the EKS service may recreate log group using the service role. This will result in terraform errors if the same blueprint is recreated. To proceed, manually delete the log group using the console or cli rerun the <code>terraform destroy</code>.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"faq/#provider-authentication","title":"Provider Authentication","text":"<p>The chain of events when provisioning an example is typically in the stages of VPC -&gt; EKS cluster -&gt; addons and manifests. Per Terraform's recommendation, it is not recommended to pass an unknown value into provider configurations. However, for the sake of simplicity and ease of use, Blueprints does specify the AWS provider along with the Kubernetes, Helm, and Kubectl providers in order to show the full configuration required for provisioning example. Note - this is the configuration required to provision the example, not necessarily the shape of how the configuration should be structured; users are encouraged to split up EKS cluster creation from addon and manifest provisioning to align with Terraform's recommendations.</p> <p>With that said, the examples here are combining the providers and users can sometimes encounter various issues with the provider authentication methods. There are primarily two methods for authenticating the Kubernetes, Helm, and Kubectl providers to the EKS cluster created:</p> <ol> <li>Using a static token which has a lifetime of 15 minutes per the EKS service documentation.</li> <li>Using the <code>exec()</code> method which will fetch a token at the time of Terraform invocation.</li> </ol> <p>The Kubernetes and Helm providers recommend the <code>exec()</code> method, however this has the caveat that it requires the awscli to be installed on the machine running Terraform AND of at least a minimum version to support the API spec used by the provider (i.e. - <code>\"client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1\"</code>, <code>\"client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1\"</code>, etc.). Selecting the appropriate provider authentication method is left up to users, and the examples used in this project will default to using the static token method for ease of use.</p> <p>Users of the static token method should be aware that if they receive a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> message, they might have a token that has expired and will need to run <code>terraform refresh</code> to get a new token. Users of the <code>exec()</code> method should be aware that the <code>exec()</code> method is reliant on the awscli and the associated authentication API version; the awscli version may need to be updated to support a later API version required by the Kubernetes version in use.</p> <p>The following examples demonstrate either method that users can utilize - please refer to the associated provider's documentation for further details on configuration.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#static-token-example","title":"Static Token Example","text":"<pre><code>provider \"kubernetes\" {\nhost                   = module.eks.cluster_endpoint\ncluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(module.eks.cluster_certificate_authority_data)\ntoken                  = data.aws_eks_cluster_auth.this.token\n}\nprovider \"helm\" {\nkubernetes {\nhost                   = module.eks.cluster_endpoint\ncluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(module.eks.cluster_certificate_authority_data)\ntoken                  = data.aws_eks_cluster_auth.this.token\n}\n}\nprovider \"kubectl\" {\napply_retry_count      = 10\nhost                   = module.eks.cluster_endpoint\ncluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(module.eks.cluster_certificate_authority_data)\nload_config_file       = false\ntoken                  = data.aws_eks_cluster_auth.this.token\n}\ndata \"aws_eks_cluster_auth\" \"this\" {\nname = module.eks.cluster_name\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"faq/#exec-example","title":"<code>exec()</code> Example","text":"<p>Usage of exec plugin for AWS credentials</p> <p>Links to References related to this issue</p> <ul> <li>https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29182</li> <li>https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/pull/6476</li> </ul> <pre><code>provider \"kubernetes\" {\nhost                   = module.eks.cluster_endpoint\ncluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(module.eks.cluster_certificate_authority_data)\nexec {\napi_version = \"client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1\"\ncommand     = \"aws\"\n    # This requires the awscli to be installed locally where Terraform is executed\nargs = [\"eks\", \"get-token\", \"--cluster-name\", module.eks.cluster_name]\n}\n}\nprovider \"helm\" {\nkubernetes {\nhost                   = module.eks.cluster_endpoint\ncluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(module.eks.cluster_certificate_authority_data)\nexec {\napi_version = \"client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1\"\ncommand     = \"aws\"\n      # This requires the awscli to be installed locally where Terraform is executed\nargs = [\"eks\", \"get-token\", \"--cluster-name\", module.eks.cluster_name]\n}\n}\n}\nprovider \"kubectl\" {\napply_retry_count      = 5\nhost                   = module.eks.cluster_endpoint\ncluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(module.eks.cluster_certificate_authority_data)\nload_config_file       = false\nexec {\napi_version = \"client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1\"\ncommand     = \"aws\"\n    # This requires the awscli to be installed locally where Terraform is executed\nargs = [\"eks\", \"get-token\", \"--cluster-name\", module.eks.cluster_name]\n}\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"faq/#unable-to-destroy-namespace-created-by-terraform","title":"Unable to destroy namespace created by Terraform","text":"<p>In some cases, when you try to run terraform destroy on kubernetes resources created by Terraform such as namespace, you may end up seeing failures such as timeout and context deadline exceeded failures.

With almost 1,200 projects on the CNCF roadmap, the number of various ways and methods that a project allows for deploying onto a cluster (i.e. - Datadog offers 5 different Helm charts for its service, Prometheus hosts over 30 Helm charts for its services), as well as the number of different tools used to provision addons (i.e. - Terraform, ArgoCD, FluxCD, etc.), supporting both the number of addons and their different forms has been extremely challenging for the team. In addition to managing just the sheer number of addons, supporting the different configurations that users wish to have exposed in conjunction with testing and validating those various configurations is only compounded by the number of addons and their methods of creation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing resources provisioned on the cluster using Terraform. Terraform is a fantastic tool for provisioning infrastructure and it is the tool of choice for many customers when it comes to creating resources in AWS. However, there are a number of downsides with Terraform when it comes to provisioning resources on a Kubernetes cluster. These include:</p> </li> <li> <p>Ordering of dependencies when relationships live outside of Terraform's HCL syntax. Terraform wants to evaluate the current state of what it controls and be able to plan a series of actions to align the current state with the desired state in one action. It does this once for each <code>terraform plan</code> or <code>terraform apply</code>, and if any issues are encountered, it simply fails and halts execution. When Terraform cannot infer the ordering of dependencies across resources (i.e. - through passing outputs of parent resources to arguments of child resources using the Terraform <code>&lt;resource&gt;.&lt;name&gt;.&lt;attribute&gt;</code> syntax), it will view this as no relationship between the resources and attempt to execute their provisioning in parallel and asynchronously. Any resources that are left waiting for a dependency will eventually timeout and fail, causing Terraform itself to timeout and fail the apply. This is where the reconciliation loop of a Kubernetes controller or operator on the cluster is better suited - continuously trying to reconcile the state over and over again as dependencies are eventually resolved. (To be clear - the issue of dependency ordering still exists, but the controller/operator will keep retrying and on each retry, some resources will succeed which will move the execution along with each cycle until everything is fully deployed. Terraform could do this if it kept re-trying, but it does not do this today)</p> </li> <li> <p>Publicly exposing access to the EKS endpoints in order to provision resources defined outside of the VPC onto the cluster. When using Terraform, the resource provisioning operation is a \"push\" model where Terraform will send requests to the EKS API Server to create resources. Coupled with the fact that the Terraform operation typically resides outside of the VPC where the cluster is running, this results in users enabling public access to the EKS endpoints to provision resources. However, the more widely accepted approach by the Kubernetes community has been the adoption of GitOps which uses a \"pull\" based model, where an operator or controller running on the cluster will pull the resource definitions from a Git repository and reconcile state from within the cluster itself. This approach is more secure as it does not require public access to the EKS endpoints and instead relies on the cluster's internal network to communicate with the EKS API Server.</p> </li> <li> <p>The nesting of multiple sub-modules in conjunction with the necessity to even require a module to be able to support an addon. When we compare and contrast the Terraform approach to addons versus the GitOps approach, the Terraform approach has a glaring disadvantage - the need to create a module that wraps the addon's Helm chart in order to provision the addon via Terraform. As opposed to the GitOps approach, where users simply consume the charts from where they are stored as needed. This creates a bottleneck on the team to review, test, and validate each new addon as well as the overhead then added for maintaining and updating those addons going forward. This also opens up more areas where breaking changes are encountered which is compounded by the fact that Terraform addons are grouped under an \"umbrella\" module which obfuscates versioning.</p> </li> <li> <p>Being able to support a combination of various tools, modules, frameworks, etc., to meet the needs of customers. The <code>terraform-aws-eks</code> was created long before EKS Blueprints, and many customers had already adopted this module for creating their clusters. In addition, Amazon has since adopted the <code>eksctl</code> as the official CLI for Amazon EKS. When EKS Blueprints was first announced, many customers raised questions asking if they needed to abandon their current clusters created through those other tools in order to adopt EKS Blueprints. The answer is no - users can and should be able to use their existing clusters while EKS Blueprints can help augment that process through its supporting modules (addons, teams, etc.). This left the team with the question - why create a Terraform module for creating an EKS cluster when the <code>terraform-aws-eks</code> already exists and the EKS Blueprints implementation already uses that module for creating the control plane and security groups?</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"v4-to-v5/motivation/#what-is-changing","title":"What Is Changing","text":"<p>The direction for EKS Blueprints in v5 will shift from providing an all-encompassing, monolithic \"framework\" and instead focus more on how users can organize a set of modular components to create the desired solution on Amazon EKS.

In its place, users can utilize the KMS key creation functionality of the <code>terraform-aws-eks</code> module or the <code>terraform-aws-kms</code> module if they wish to control the key separately from the cluster itself.</li> <li>The <code>emr-on-eks</code> module will be removed entirely; its replacement can be found in the new external module <code>terraform-aws-emr</code>.</li> <li>The <code>irsa</code> and <code>helm-addon</code> modules will be removed entirely; we have released a new external module <code>terraform-aws-eks-blueprints-addon</code> that is available on the Terraform registry that replicates/replaces the functionality of these two modules. This will now allow users, as well as partners, to create their own addons that are not natively supported by EKS Blueprints more easily and following the same process as EKS Blueprints.</li> <li>The <code>aws-eks-teams</code> module will be removed entirely; its replacement will be the new external module <code>terraform-aws-eks-blueprints-teams</code> that incorporates the changes customers have been asking for in https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints/issues/842</li> <li>The integration between Terraform and ArgoCD has been removed in the initial release of v5. The team is currently investigating better patterns and solutions in conjunction with the ArgoCD and FluxCD teams that will provide a better, more integrated experience when using a GitOps based approach for cluster management. This will be released in a future version of EKS Blueprints v5 and is tracked here</li> </ol>"},{"location":"v4-to-v5/motivation/#resulting-project-structure","title":"Resulting Project Structure","text":"<p>Previously under the v4.x structure, the EKS Blueprint project was comprised of various repositories across multiple AWS organizations that looked roughly like the following:</p>"},{"location":"v4-to-v5/motivation/#v4x-structure","title":"v4.x Structure","text":"<pre><code>\u251c\u2500\u2500 aws-ia/\n|   \u251c\u2500\u2500 terraform-aws-eks-ack-addons/\n|   \u2514\u2500\u2500 terraform-aws-eks-blueprints/\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500 aws-auth-configmap.tf\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500 data.tf\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500 eks-worker.tf\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500 locals.tf\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.tf\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500 outputs.tf\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500 variables.tf\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500 versions.tf\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500 examples/\n|       \u2514\u2500\u2500 modules\n|           \u251c\u2500\u2500 aws-eks-fargate-profiles/\n|           \u251c\u2500\u2500 aws-eks-managed-node-groups/\n|           \u251c\u2500\u2500 aws-eks-self-managed-node-groups/\n|           \u251c\u2500\u2500 aws-eks-teams/\n|           \u251c\u2500\u2500 aws-kms/\n|           \u251c\u2500\u2500 emr-on-eks/\n|           \u251c\u2500\u2500 irsa/\n|           \u251c\u2500\u2500 kubernetes-addons/\n|           \u2514\u2500\u2500 launch-templates/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 awslabs/\n|   \u251c\u2500\u2500 crossplane-on-eks/\n|   \u2514\u2500\u2500 data-on-eks/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 aws-samples/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 eks-blueprints-add-ons/   # Previously shared with the CDK based EKS Blueprints project\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 eks-blueprints-workloads/ # Previously shared with the CDK based EKS Blueprints project\n</code></pre> <p>Under th new v5.x structure, the Terraform based EKS Blueprints project will be comprised of the following repositories:</p>"},{"location":"v4-to-v5/motivation/#v5x-structure","title":"v5.x Structure","text":"<pre><code>\u251c\u2500\u2500 aws-ia/\n|   \u251c\u2500\u2500 terraform-aws-eks-ack-addons/\n|   \u251c\u2500\u2500 terraform-aws-eks-blueprints/       # Will contain only example/blueprint implementations; no modules\n|   \u251c\u2500\u2500 terraform-aws-eks-blueprints-addon  # Module for creating Terraform based addon (IRSA + Helm chart)\n|   \u251c\u2500\u2500 terraform-aws-eks-blueprints-addons # Will contain a select set of addons supported by the EKS Blueprints\n|   \u2514\u2500\u2500 terraform-aws-eks-blueprints-teams  # Was previously `aws-eks-teams/` EKS Blueprint sub-module; updated based on customer feedback\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 awslabs/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 crossplane-on-eks/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 data-on-eks/        # Data related patterns that used to be located in `terraform-aws-eks-blueprints/` are now located here\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"v4-to-v5/motivation/#what-can-users-expect","title":"What Can Users Expect","text":"<p>With these changes, the team intends to provide a better experience for users of the Terraform EKS Blueprints project as well as new and improved reference architectures. Following the v5 changes, the team intends to:</p> <ol> <li>Improved quality of the examples provided - more information on the intent of the example, why it might be useful for users, what scenarios is the pattern applicable, etc. Where applicable, architectural diagrams and supporting material will be provided to highlight the intent of the example and how its constructed.</li> <li>A more clear distinction between a blueprint and a usage reference. For example - the Karpenter on EKS Fargate blueprint should demonstrate all of the various aspects that users should be aware of and consider in order to take full advantage of this pattern (recommended practices, observability, logging, monitoring, security, day 2 operations, etc.); this is what makes it a blueprint. In contrast, a usage reference would be an example that shows how users can pass configuration values to the Karpenter provisioner. This example is less focused on the holistic architecture and more focused on how one might configure Karpenter using the implementation. The EKS Blueprints repository will focus mostly on holistic architecture and patterns, and any usage references should be saved for the repository that contains that implementation definition (i.e. - the <code>terraform-aws-eks-blueprints-addons</code> repository where the addon implementation is defined).</li> <li>Faster, and more responsive feedback. The first part of this is going to be improved documentation on how to contribute which should help clarify whether a contribution is worthy and willing to be accepted by the team before any effort is spent by the contributor. However, the goal of v5 is to focus more on the value added benefits that EKS Blueprints was created to provide as opposed to simply mass producing Helm chart wrappers (addons) and trying to keep up with that operationally intensive process.</li> <li>Lastly, more examples and blueprints that demonstrate various architectures and workloads that run on top of Amazon EKS as well as integrations into other AWS services.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"v4-to-v5/teams/","title":"Migrate to EKS Blueprints Teams Module","text":"<p>Please consult the docs/v4-to-v5/example directory for reference configurations.
